Problems with method inline:
1)	We need to understand overridden functions:
func(String a, String b) {}
func(Object a, Object b) {}
Now we have method invocation:
func(a, b)
We cannot understand what type a and b have (AST framework/ javalang  doesn’t allow to do it). So, we ignore overridden functions
2)	How can we change all parameters is function when we are inlining?
func(String a, int  b) { a = “4”; a += “5”; Int i = 0; func1(a, b)}

We need to replace all occurrences of a parameter. AST framework/ javalang doesn’t allow to do it, we cannot do it via regexp, since we will have lots of errors.
I suggested the following way:

If we have method invocation:
func(“5”, 4)
           …, we can extract new variables with the same type:
                String a  = “5”; 
                Int  b = 4;
             a = “4”; \\ start inline
              a += “5”; 
              Int i = 0; 
              func1(a, b) \\ end inline

                But in this case we can loose all data if a and b is used before and after method invocation.

3)	We need to take cast into account, since there can be the following cases:
a.	String a = (String) getProperty(SECURITY_MANAGER, 6);

b.	String a = null;
A = (String) getProperty(SECURITY_MANAGER, 6);

Object  getProperty(String a, int b) { … }

But we do not know type of a variable, since it is not supported in AST and javalang

So, we cannot do casts

4)	Suppose we have the following method invocation:
  try {
                    String name = SECURITY_MANAGER;
                    setProperty(SECURITY_MANAGER, value ? new SecurityManager() : null);  //method invocation
                }
                catch (SAXNotRecognizedException exc) {
                    // If the property is not supported 
                    // re-throw the exception if the value is true.
                    if (value) {
                        throw exc;
                    }
                }
  

         Original function is the following:
         public void setProperty_original(String name, Object value) throws SAXNotRecognizedException, SAXNotSupportedException { xmlReader.setProperty(name, value); }

As you see, the 2nd parameter is the ternary operator: “value ? new SecurityManager() : null”.
It can be more difficult and we cannot extract this into variable with the method, described in 2)
We need to generate code from AST. AST framework/javalang doesn’t support it.
So, the main problem is that we cannot generate code from AST tree, that’ why we cannot make automatic sciprt for gathering data. All data need to be validated manually

5)	It is extremely difficult to create a separate class with all methods inline, since we cannot generate source code from AST tree, we cannot remove other methods.
Every time we insert code we need to recalculate lines of code for each methods, since new line appear.


6)	for(int i = getConnections(); i < 5; ++i){
Variable declaration here, and we can handle method inv in var declaration, but in for cycle it is difficult understand that it is inside for loop
7)	InputHandler	int ox = schemOriginX(), oy = func();
We cannot understand multiple variable declaration
8)	Difficult to understand if/for/while with 1 statement without braces.
We need to find such cases and insert square braces when inlining
9)	case: consumeNewline();
Need to add square brackets everytime
